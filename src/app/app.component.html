    <h1>Read Reciept</h1>
    <p>
      Email senders can use a trick called a tracking pixel to know exactly when you open their emails, just like a read
      reciept.
    </p>
    <p>These pixels are not only hard to detect, but they also give away lots of personal information!</p>
    <p>
      Using this tool, you can receive an email containing my implementation of a tracking pixel to see the type of
      information you're giving away simply by opening an email.
