  <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p>
    You received this email because your email address was entered into the tool
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="{{domain}}">Read Receipt</a>
    created by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tobysmith.uk">Toby Smith</a>.

  <p>
    This email contains a 'tracking pixel'. A tiny invisible image which, when loaded by you opening this email, gave
    away not only that you opened this email, but also some personal information about you and your device.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some email providers are able to block these pixels, but assuming that it was successful, opening this email will
    trigger another email to be sent to you. This second email, which you should have already received by now, contains
    all of the information I was able to gather from you opening this email.
  </p>

    This tool stores <b>none</b> of your personal information. It's totally stateless with no cookies,
    databases, logs, or anything else! You can check the source code on
